# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project focuses on building the back-end server for the **What to Wear?** (WTWR) application. The goal is to create a server that manages user authentication, stores data, and provides an API for interaction with the front-end. It includes working with databases, setting up security, testing the server, and deploying to a remote server. Features such as user authorization and API endpoints for clothing items will be implemented.

## ðŸ§° Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the server-side application
- **MongoDB** for the database and **Mongoose** for MongoDB ODM (Object Data Modeling)
- **Nodemon** for development with hot reloading


## Running the Project
`npm run start` â€” to launch the server 

`npm run dev` â€” to launch the server with the hot reload feature
